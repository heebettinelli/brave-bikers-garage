<h1>Brave Bikers Garage</h1>

<p>Brave Bikers Garage is a motorcycle workshop located in Lisbon, recognized for its solid presence and engagement with customers through Instagram. Aiming to further improve communication and relationship capabilities with its customers, I proposed the implementation of a personalized biolink using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project aims to create a more interactive and personalized experience for the workshop's followers, allowing intuitive navigation through relevant information, such as services offered, opening hours, special events and much more. Through this technological solution, Brave Bikers Garage seeks to strengthen ties with its online community, providing a unique and efficient digital experience.</p>
